/**
 * Annotation to indicate that a simulation transform has been applied to the
 * element. When used, the value element must have the name of the simulation
 * transformer. The convention is to use the fully qualified name of the
 * transformer in the value field. For example: com.company.package.classname.
 * <p>
 * The date element is used to indicate the date the element was transformed.
 * The date element must follow the ISO 8601 standard. For example the date
 * element would have the following value 2001-07-04T12:08:56.235-0700 which
 * represents 2001-07-04 12:08:56 local time in the U.S. Pacific Time time zone.
 * <p.>
 * The comment element is a place holder for any comments that the transformer
 * may want to include in the generated code.
