/**
 * A {@linkplain Queue blocking queue} in which each insert operation must wait
 * for a corresponding remove operation by another thread, and vice versa. A
 * synchronous queue does not have any internal capacity, not even a capacity of
 * one. You cannot <tt>peek</tt> at a synchronous queue because an element is
 * only present when you try to remove it; you cannot insert an element (using
 * any method) unless another thread is trying to remove it; you cannot iterate
 * as there is nothing to iterate. The <em>head</em> of the queue is the element
 * that the first queued inserting thread is trying to add to the queue; if
 * there is no such queued thread then no element is available for removal and
 * <tt>poll()</tt> will return <tt>null</tt>. For purposes of other
 * <tt>Collection</tt> methods (for example <tt>contains</tt>), a
 * <tt>SynchronousQueue</tt> acts as an empty collection. This queue does not
 * permit <tt>null</tt> elements.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Synchronous queues are similar to rendezvous channels used in CSP and Ada.
 * They are well suited for handoff designs, in which an object running in one
 * thread must sync up with an object running in another thread in order to hand
 * it some information, event, or task.
 * 
 * @param <E>
 *            the type of elements held in this collection
