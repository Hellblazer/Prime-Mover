/**
 * An interface for access points that allow to set the accessed parameter's value (and not only read it as in
 * AccessPoint). This pattern can be found in several frameworks for agent- or component-based simulation (e.g. 'Probes'
 * in Swarm - see www.swarm.org). The term 'access point' was adopted from the dissertation "Ein flexibler,
 * CORBA-basierter Ansatz fuer die verteilte, komponentenorientierte Simulation" by Ralf Bachmann (2003).
